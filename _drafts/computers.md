If you're reading this post, you've used a computer before. I'm currently using a computer to type this. In fact, computers are all around us. I'd go so far as to say it's impossible to live in modern life without computers.

You may have wondered how computers work before. I certianly have. You may have even heard things like "it's a bunch of switches," but if you actually think about it, that doesn't make actual _sense_.  Like, how can switches do math.

In this series of posts, I hope to explain how computers _actually work_, not just "it's a bunch of switches," or "ones and zeros," and so on.

## Digital signals

Now, there's only a few things you really need to understand to get a fundimental understanding of how computers work, and one of those things is digital signals. There's an important unit: _voltage_, written as $V$. Voltage is a measure of _difference in electric potential_, but it doesn't really matter what that means. You can think of voltage as the amount of electricity travelling through a wire.

We differentiate electrical circuits in two types, _analog circuits_, which use many different values of voltage, and _digital circuits_, which only use two. We call these 0 and 1 (though they usually aren't actually 0V and 1V, common values are 0V and 3.3V or 0V and 5V). We refer to 0 as ground, or occasionally, `GND`, and 1 as `VCC` or `VDD`.

We also have symbols that represent sources VCC and GND
